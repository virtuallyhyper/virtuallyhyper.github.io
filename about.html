  VirtuallyHyper is a virtualization blog that provides tips, tricks, solutions, and guides on different virtualization and cloud technologies (mostly VMware and AWS). VirtuallyHyper was created by 3 ex-VMware employees who are virtualization fanatics addicted to virtualization technologies (thus the name of the blog). They each are VCP and VCAP (DCA & DCD) certified in both vSphere 4 and 5, and graduated from the University of Colorado in Boulder with B.S. degrees in Computer Science (Karim also has an M.S. in Telecommunications). <a href="{{ site.data.authors['Jarret Lavallee'].web }}">Jarret</a>, <a href="{{ site.data.authors['Joe Chan'].web }}">Joe</a>, and <a href="{{ site.data.authors['Karim Elatov'].web }}">Karim</a> capture their virtualization experiences in this blog to help educate and provide solutions to others. We certainly hope this blog can help some of you out there with your virtualization journey. Please leave us a comment or shoot us an email if you found something helpful!
