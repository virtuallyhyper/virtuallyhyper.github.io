As I was creating an [OpenSUSE base box](/2014/06/create-a-base-opensuse-image-for-vagrant/) for vagrant, I realized that it was still kind of big in size. I wanted to create a minimal base OS of the OpenSUSE Linux Distribution. That is when I ran into [SUSE Studio](https://susestudio.com/). From [SUSE's site](https://www.suse.com/products/susestudio/technical-information/):

> SUSE Studio is a web-based application for building and testing software applications in a web browser. It supports the creation of physical, virtual or cloud-based applications by leveraging the software appliance form-factor. It enables you to build your own application images or appliances based on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. SUSE Studio is available as an online or onsite version.

You can basically create your own custom image of the SUSE Linux Distribution and customizing every aspect in the process. So let's give it a try, go to **https://susestudio.com/** and login, after you login you will see the available templates:

![opensuse-templates](http://assets.virtuallyhyper.com/2014-06-opensuse-templates.png)

Since we are trying to minimize the size, let's select "Just Enough OS" then scroll down, select the archicture, give this applicance name:


![ss-arch-name-app](http://assets.virtuallyhyper.com/2014-06-ss-arch-name-app.png)

After clicking on "Create Appliance", it will take you to the configuration:

![ss-config-your-app](http://assets.virtuallyhyper.com/2014-06-ss-config-your-app.png)

Then click on "Switch to the Software tab to continue", and it will take you to the software tab where you can customize what RPMs are included in your custom image:

![ss-software-tab](http://assets.virtuallyhyper.com/2014-06-ss-software-tab.png)

Let's add the **sudo** package, since vagrant uses that, (while we are at it let's add **zerofree** and **curl**):

![ss-add-sudo](http://assets.virtuallyhyper.com/2014-06-ss-add-sudo.png)

After that go to the **Configuration** tab, configure the timezone, enable the firewall (after enabling the firewall it will ask you to add the **SuSEfirewall2** package), and add the vagrant user:

![ss-config-tab](http://assets.virtuallyhyper.com/2014-06-ss-config-tab.png)

Then go to the Appliance subsection and configure LVM:

![ss-configure-appliance-subtab](http://assets.virtuallyhyper.com/2014-06-ss-configure-appliance-subtab.png)

Then go to the **Build** Tab and select the "VMware Workstation/Virtualbox Format":

![ss-image-format-drop-down](http://assets.virtuallyhyper.com/2014-06-ss-image-format-drop-down.png)

Then click on **Build** to start the creation of your custom image:

![ss-creating-image](http://assets.virtuallyhyper.com/2014-06-ss-creating-image.png)

After the build is done, you can download it:

![ss-build-finished](http://assets.virtuallyhyper.com/2014-06-ss-build-finished.png)

After you have the file, extract it:

	elatov@kmac:~/download$tar xvzf openSUSE_13.1.x86_64-0.0.2.vmx.tar.gz
	x openSUSE_13.1-0.0.2/
	x openSUSE_13.1-0.0.2/openSUSE_13.1.x86_64-0.0.2.vmx
	x openSUSE_13.1-0.0.2/openSUSE_13.1.x86_64-0.0.2.vmdk

Now let's add a new VM in VirtualBox and point the virtual disk to the extract vmdk file. So start VirtualBox, click on **New** VM, and give it a Name:

![VirtualBox_Name-the_VM](http://assets.virtuallyhyper.com/2014-06-VirtualBox_Name-the_VM.png)

When it gets to the hard-drive page, select "Use an existing virtual hard drive file" and point to the vmdk:

![vb-select-vmdk](http://assets.virtuallyhyper.com/2014-06-vb-select-vmdk.png)

After the VM is created, disable the USB ports, audio device and the floppy device in the boot menu. Start the VM and follow the instructions laid out [here](/2014/06/create-a-base-opensuse-image-for-vagrant/) to finish the customization of the VM. As a side note, it won't bring up the first interface by default so login as root to the appliance and run the following to get an IP via DHCP (then you can SSH to the VM using port forwarding like before):

	linux-mjbf:~ # dhcpd enp0s3

To enable the interface to automatically use DHCP, copy the template:

	linux-mjbf:~ # cp /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg.template /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-enp0s3

And then enable DHCP:

	linux-mjbf:~ #vi /etc/sysconfig/network-enp0s3

Modify the following lines:

	STARTMODE=auto
	BOOTPROTO=dhcp4
	DHCLIENT_SET_DEFAULT_ROUTE=yes
	
**NOTE** Ran into a bug [Bug 802970 - Default gateway not set up after first user logs in](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=802970), that's why the **DHCLIENT_SET** option was used.
	
Also the boot partition is already labeled:

	vagrant@linux-mjbf:~> sudo e2label /dev/sda1
	BOOT

so you don't have to re-label it, just use that label in **/etc/fstab**. While you are in the **/etc/fstab** file, fix the swap partition. Change this line:

	/dev/mapper/systemVG-LVSwap /swap ext3 default 1 2

to this:

	/dev/mapper/systemVG-LVSwap swap swap default 0 0

And format that partition as **swap**:

	vagrant@linux-mjbf:~> sudo mkswap /dev/mapper/systemVG-LVSwap

On top of what's in the previous post, to clean up the Grub Menu, edit the **/etc/default/grub** file and modify these lines:

	GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=openSUSE_13.1\ \[\ VMX\ \]
	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=" root=/dev/systemVG/LVRoot disk=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-VBOX_HARDDISK_VBf1d999b3-c951ba39 resume=swap quiet splash=silent"

to this:

	GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=openSUSE_13.1
	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=" root=/dev/systemVG/LVRoot resume=swap quiet splash=0"

Then run the following to create a new **grub** menu and to rebuild the **initrd** image:

	vagrant@linux-mjbf:~> sudo mkinitrd
	
	Kernel image:   /boot/vmlinuz-3.11.10-11-default
	Initrd image:   /boot/initrd-3.11.10-11-default
	Root device:	/dev/systemVG/LVRoot (mounted on / as ext3)
	Kernel Modules:	thermal_sys thermal processor fan usb-common usbcore ehci-hcd ohci-hcd uhci-hcd xhci-hcd dm-mod dm-log dm-region-hash dm-mirror dm-snapshot scsi_dh scsi_dh_alua scsi_dh_hp_sw scsi_dh_emc scsi_dh_rdac usbhid hid-logitech-dj hid-generic hid-holtek-kbd hid-lenovo-tpkbd hid-ortek hid-roccat hid-roccat-common hid-roccat-arvo hid-roccat-isku hid-samsung ehci-pci ohci-pci linear
	Features:       acpi dm plymouth block usb lvm2 resume.userspace resume.kernel


To build the virtualbox guest additions, install these packages prior:

	sudo zypper in kernel-devel kernel-default-devel gcc make
 
 After creating the box:
 
	elatov@kmac:~/vagrant-boxes$ vagrant package --output vagrant-stu-min-opensuse13-64.box --base opensuse13-64
 
 Here is was the final size:
 
	elatov@kmac:~/vagrant-boxes$ls -lh
	total 7427872
	-rw-r--r--  1 elatov  staff   688M Jun 11 12:35 vagrant-opensuse13-32bit-small.box
	-rw-r--r--  1 elatov  staff   823M Jun 11 10:54 vagrant-opensuse13-32bit.box
	-rw-r--r--  1 elatov  staff   532M Jun 12 12:01 vagrant-opensuse13-64-net-install.box
	-rw-r--r--  1 elatov  staff   376M Jun 15 16:42 vagrant-stu-min-opensuse13-64.box

It was less than 400MB, I started out with **823MB** and ended up with **376MB** (I even used the net-install iso... that was the 532MB image).
