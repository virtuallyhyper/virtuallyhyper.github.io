I decided to install Snort on Debian. By default the debian apt sources do have a snort package but it's out of date.





### Snort Version on Debian





Here is the is version available for Debian:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$apt-cache showpkg snort
    Package: snort
    Versions: 
    2.9.2.2-3 (/var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.us.debian.org_debian_dists_wheezy_main_binary-amd64_Packages) (/var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.fr.debian.org_debian_dists_wheezy_main_binary-amd64_Packages)
    
```






So it's at 2.9.2.2 but that's already end of lifed as per [this](http://blog.snort.org/2012/08/snort-2922-is-end-of-life.html) page. So you won't be able to use tools like [pulledpork](https://code.google.com/p/pulledpork/) to download the rules for that old version. So let's build it from source.





### Compile Snort





First let's install the prerequisites:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo apt-get install flex bison libpcap-dev libdnet-dev libdumbnet-dev 
    
```






Now let's get the source:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/snort/files/snort/daq-2.0.2.tar.gz
    elatov@kerch:~$wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/snort/files/snort/snort-2.9.6.0.tar.gz
    
```






Let's build the DAQ software. Extract the source:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$tar xvzf daq-2.0.2.tar.gz
    
```






Now let's prepare the source:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$cd daq-2.0.2
    elatov@kerch:~$./configure --prefix=/usr/local/snort
    
```






Now let's compile the software:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$make
    
```






If the compile is successful, let's install it:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo mkdir /usr/local/snort
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo chown elatov:elatov /usr/local/snort
    elatov@kerch:~$make install
    
```






Now let's do the same thing for snort




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$tar xvzf snort-2.9.6.0.tar.gz
    elatov@kerch:~$cd snort-2.9.6.0
    elatov@kerch:~$./configure --prefix=/usr/local/snort --with-daq-includes=/usr/local/snort/include --with-daq-libraries=/usr/local/snort/lib --enable-sourcefire
    elatov@kerch:~$make 
    elatov@kerch:~$make install
    
```






Now let's copy the initial configuration over:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$mkdir /usr/local/snort/etc
    elatov@kerch:~$rsync -avzP snort-2.9.6.0/etc/*.conf* /usr/local/snort/etc/.
    elatov@kerch:~$rsync -avzP snort-2.9.6.0/etc/*.map /usr/local/snort/etc/.
    
```






Edit the main configuration file **/usr/local/snort/etc/snort.conf** and modify the following:




    

```
    ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8
    ipvar EXTERNAL_NET !HOME_NET
    var RULE_PATH ./rules
    var WHITE_LIST_PATH ./rules
    var BLACK_LIST_PATH ./rules
    output unified2: filename merged.log, limit 128, mpls_event_types, vlan_event_types
    config logdir: /usr/local/snort/var/log
    dynamicpreprocessor directory /usr/local/snort/lib/snort_dynamicpreprocessor/
    dynamicengine /usr/local/snort/lib/snort_dynamicengine/libsf_engine.so
    dynamicdetection directory /usr/local/snort/lib/snort_dynamicrules
    # comment out the specific rules, lines 547 to 661
    #include $RULE_PATH/app-detect.rules
    #include $RULE_PATH/attack-responses.rules
    #include $RULE_PATH/backdoor.rules
    
```






Here is an easy command to delete the rules from the configuration file:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sed -i '/^include $RULE_PATH/d' /usr/local/snort/etc/snort.conf
    
```






Now let'd add the snort user and group:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo groupadd snort
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo useradd -g snort snort
    
```






Let's create the rest of the directories that we will be used by **pulledpork**:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$mkdir /usr/local/snort/etc/rules
    elatov@kerch:~$mkdir /usr/local/snort/lib/snort_dynamicrules
    elatov@kerch:~$mkdir /usr/local/snort/etc/rules/iplists
    elatov@kerch:~$mkdir -p /usr/local/snort/var/log
    elatov@kerch:~$touch /usr/local/snort/etc/rules/local.rules
    elatov@kerch:~$touch /usr/local/snort/etc/rules/white_list.rules
    elatov@kerch:~$touch /usr/local/snort/etc/rules/black_list.rules
    
```






### Get Snort Rules with PulledPork





First let's install the prerequisites for the **pulledpork** package:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo apt-get install libcrypt-ssleay-perl liblwp-protocol-https-perl
    
```






Now let's get the package:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$svn checkout http://pulledpork.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pulledpork-read-only
    
```






Now let's prepare the installation directory:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo mkdir /usr/local/pp
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo chown elatov:elatov /usr/local/pp
    elatov@kerch:~$mkdir /usr/local/pp/etc
    elatov@kerch:~$mkdir /usr/local/pp/bin
    
```






Lastly let's copy the necessary files:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$rsync -avzP pulledpork-read-only/etc/.  /usr/local/pp/etc/.
    elatov@kerch:~$rsync -avzP pulledpork-read-only/pulledpork.pl /usr/local/pp/bin/.
    
```






Now edit the configuration to fit your needs. Here is what I ended up with:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$grep -Ev '^$|^#' /usr/local/pp/etc/pulledpork.conf
    rule_url=https://www.snort.org/reg-rules/|snortrules-snapshot.tar.gz|xxxx
    rule_url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/snort-org/www/rules/community/|community-rules.tar.gz|Community
    rule_url=http://labs.snort.org/feeds/ip-filter.blf|IPBLACKLIST|xxxxx
    ignore=deleted.rules,experimental.rules,local.rules
    temp_path=/tmp
    rule_path=/usr/local/snort/etc/rules/snort.rules
    local_rules=/usr/local/snort/etc/rules/local.rules
    sid_msg=/usr/local/snort/etc/sid-msg.map
    sid_msg_version=1
    sid_changelog=/usr/local/snort/var/log/sid_changes.log
    sorule_path=/usr/local/snort/lib/snort_dynamicrules
    snort_path=/usr/local/snort/bin/snort
    config_path=/usr/local/snort/etc/snort.conf
    distro=Debian-6-0
    black_list=/usr/local/snort/etc/rules/iplists/default.blacklist
    IPRVersion=/usr/local/snort/etc/rules/iplists
    version=0.7.0
    
```






The xxxx at the end some of the lines corresponds to your oinkcode. Register at [snort](https://www.snort.org/login) to get a oinkcode. There are other rules available as well, for example there is [Emerging Threats](http://www.emergingthreats.net/). The configuration to download rules from _EmergingThreats_ is already in the default **pulledpork** configuration file (you just have to enable them, if you want to use them). I initially left them out, just to get used to the current rules first.





Now run the following to get the rules:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$/usr/local/pp/bin/pulledpork.pl -c /usr/local/pp/etc/pulledpork.conf -l
        http://code.google.com/p/pulledpork/

```






Now let's add the community rules to be parsed by snort:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$echo "include \$RULE_PATH/snort.rules" >> /usr/local/snort/etc/snort.conf
    
```






Now make sure snort can start up up without issues:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo /usr/local/snort/bin/snort -c /usr/local/snort/etc/snort.conf -T
    
```






At the end should see this:




    

```
    Running in Test mode
    
            --== Initializing Snort ==--
    Initializing Output Plugins!
    Initializing Preprocessors!
    Initializing Plug-ins!
    Parsing Rules file "/usr/local/snort/etc/snort.conf"
    
    Snort successfully validated the configuration!
    Snort exiting
    
```






If you want to see what snort is catching, you can run the following as a test:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$ sudo /usr/local/snort/bin/snort -A console -q -u snort -g snort -c /usr/local/snort/etc/snort.conf -i eth0
    
```






and you should see alerts that snorts catches:




    

```
    4/01-16:17:24.811261  [**] [129:12:1] Consecutive TCP small segments exceeding threshold [**] [Classification: Potentially Bad Traffic] [Priority: 2] {TCP} 216.98.195.98:50932 -> 67.172.135.80:4172
    
```






Hit **Ctlr-C** to stop the above process, after you confirm it's seeing traffic. To automatically grab new rules, we can add the **pulledpork** command to the snort user to be run weekly.





### Install Barnyard2 for Snort





To help snort process all the packets it recommended to use Barnyard. Barnyard is a processing software which processes a unified2 format file and stores the results in a MySQL database. This way, snort just logs to a file and doesn't have to waste cycles writing to a database. Let's install the software, first let's get the prerequisites:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$ sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev libmysqld-dev
    
```






Now let's get the source:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$wget http://www.securixlive.com/download/barnyard2/barnyard2-1.9.tar.gz
    
```






Now let's install the software:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$tar xvzf barnyard2-1.9.tar.gz
    elatov@kerch:~$cd barnyard2-1.9
    elatov@kerch:~$./configure --with-mysql --prefix=/usr/local/by --with-mysql-libraries=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
    elatov@kerch:~$make
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo mkdir /usr/local/by
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo chown elatov:elatov /usr/local/by/
    elatov@kerch:~$make install
    
```






Now we can configure barnyard2 to store alerts in a MySQL database. Here is how my configuration looked like:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$grep -Ev '^$|^#' /usr/local/by/etc/barnyard2.conf
    config reference_file:      /usr/local/snort/etc/reference.config
    config classification_file: /usr/local/snort/etc/classification.config
    config gen_file:            /usr/local/snort/etc/gen-msg.map
    config sid_file:            /usr/local/snort/etc/sid-msg.map
    config logdir: /usr/local/snort/var/log
    config hostname:        kerch
    config interface:       eth0
    config daemon
    config set_gid: 112
    config set_uid: 1002
    config waldo_file: /usr/local/snort/var/log/barnyard2.waldo
    input unified2
    output alert_fast: stdout
    output database: log, mysql, user=snorby password=snorby dbname=snorby host=localhost
    
```






Keep note of the password you specify and make sure when you create the MySQL database with those specifics.





Create other files that will be used upon start up:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$touch /usr/local/snort/var/log/barnyard2.waldo
    
```






### Install Snorby for Snort





Snorby is nice and organized UI that allows you to check the alerts that were caught by snort. It runs on Ruby on Rails, so let's set that up. As always, grab the prerequistes:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$ apt-get install libyaml-dev git-core default-jre imagemagick libmagickwand-dev wkhtmltopdf build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-gplv2-dev zlib1g-dev
    linux-headers-amd64 libsqlite3-dev libxslt1-dev libxml2-dev libmysqlclient-dev
    libmysql++-dev apache2-prefork-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev ruby ruby-dev
    
```






Now let's install **bundler** and **rails**:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo gem install bundler rails
    
```






Now let's install a specific version of **rake**:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo gem install rake --version=0.9.2
    Fetching: rake-0.9.2.gem (100%)
    Successfully installed rake-0.9.2
    1 gem installed
    Installing ri documentation for rake-0.9.2...
    Installing RDoc documentation for rake-0.9.2...
    
```






Now let's get the source for snorby:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$git clone http://github.com/Snorby/snorby.git
    Cloning into 'snorby'...
    remote: Reusing existing pack: 10471, done.
    remote: Total 10471 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    Receiving objects: 100% (10471/10471), 9.91 MiB | 413 KiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (4764/4764), done.
    
```






Let's configure the MySQL connection settings:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$cp snorby/config/database.yml.example snorby/config/database.yml
    
```






Now edit the **snorby/config/database.yml** file and modify the following:




    

```
    snorby: &snorby
      adapter: mysql
      username: snorby
      password: "snorby"
      host: localhost
    
```






Now let's configure the production configuration of snorby:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$cp snorby/config/snorby_config.yml.example snorby/config/snorby_config.yml
    
```






Then modify the **snorby/config/snorby_config.yml** file to have the following:




    

```
    production:
      domain: 'demo.snorby.org'
      wkhtmltopdf: /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf
      ssl: false
      mailer_sender: 'snorby@snorby.org'
      geoip_uri: "http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz"
      rules:
        - ""
      authentication_mode: database
    
```






Now let's install the dependencies necessary for snorby:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$ cd snorby
    elatov@kerch:~/snorby$ bundle install
    
```






Now let's create a MySQL database for snorby:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$mysql -u root -p
    Enter password:
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 53935
    Server version: 5.5.35-0+wheezy1 (Debian)

    Oracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and/or its
    affiliates. Other names may be trademarks of their respective
    owners.
    
    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.
    
    mysql> create database snorby;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
    
    mysql> grant ALL on snorby.* to snorby@localhost identified by 'snorby';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
    
    mysql> exit
    
```






Now let's setup snorby and let snorby create the necessary MySQL schema:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~/snorby$bundle exec rake snorby:setup
    No time_zone specified in snorby_config.yml; detected time_zone: US/Mountain
    5ff841ca217da8aabcebad4b2762f6b6f6d4a531219ea694873f9589f2ad39574c1ab9ecf7738b9922d34479addc3d5958b37ce04f20422359bef099630d8307
    ERROR 1007 (HY000) at line 1: Can't create database 'snorby'; database exists

    [~] Building `events_with_join` database view
    * Removing old jobs
    * Starting the Snorby worker process.
    * Adding jobs to the queue
    
```






Lastly go ahead and start up snorby:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~/snorby$bundle exec rails server -e production -b 127.0.0.1
    No time_zone specified in snorby_config.yml; detected time_zone: US/Mountain
    => Booting WEBrick
    => Rails 3.1.12 application starting in production on http://127.0.0.1:3000
    => Call with -d to detach
    => Ctrl-C to shutdown server
    [2014-03-31 16:04:30] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1

    [2014-03-31 16:04:30] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=28708 port=3000
    
```






At this point you can go to **http://localhost:3000** and see the following:





[![snorby-login](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/snorby-login.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/snorby-login.png)





You can login with:





> 
  
> 
> snorby@snorby.org  

  snorby
> 
> 






You won't see any alerts in there yet. Lastly let's make everything owned by the snort user and group:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo chown -R snort:snort /usr/local/snort
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo chown -R snort:snort /usr/local/pp
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo chown -R snort:snort /usr/local/by
    
```






If you want [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/snorby/eEDy-FrwHB0) is a link to a start-up script for snorby, but it looks like the recommended approach is to proxy snorby with apache using the passenger plugin. Check out the setup for that [here](http://www.aldeid.com/wiki/Snorby#Recommended_install_of_Passenger).





### Configure Snort Service





The snort source contains an init script but it's for RPM based distros (but we can still make it work). First copy the script:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo cp snort-2.9.6.0/rpm/snortd /etc/init.d/.
    
```






Then modify the script to fit your paths (in my case everything was under **/usr/local/snort**) and also add the following on top:




    

```
    ### BEGIN INIT INFO
    # Provides: snortd
    # Required-Start: $remote_fs $syslog
    # Required-Stop: $remote_fs $syslog
    # Default-Start: 2 3 4 5
    # Default-Stop: 0 1 6
    # X-Interactive: true
    # Short-Description: Start Snort
    ### END INIT INFO
    
```






After that you will be able to add it as service:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo update-rc.d snortd defaults
    update-rc.d: using dependency based boot sequencing
    
```






You can also use the script from the snort package which is in the aptitude sources. Whatever you do, copy the default configuration for the init script:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo cp snort-2.9.6.0/rpm/snort.sysconfig /etc/default/snort
    
```






And enter your configurations there:




    

```
    ALERTMODE=
    CONF=/usr/local/snort/etc/snort.conf
    LOGDIR=/usr/local/snort/var/log
    
```






Where I start the service here is how it looked like:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo service snortd start
    [info] Starting Network Intrusion Detection System  snort.
    [ ok ] using /usr/local/snort/etc/snort.conf ...done).
    
```






Here are the parameters that were passed to the snort daemon:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$ps -eaf | grep snort
    snort     2652     1  7 18:29 ?        00:00:00 /usr/local/snort/bin/snort -u snort -g snort -c /usr/local/snort/etc/snort.conf -D -i eth0
    
```






I didn't pass the Log Directory to the daemon, since it was in the **/usr/local/snort/etc/snort.conf** file and I was using unified2 format.





### Barnyard2 Init Script





The source for that also had init scripts but they were for RPM. So let's copy the necessary files:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo cp barnyard2-1.9/rpm/barnyard2 /etc/init.d/.
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo cp barnyard2-1.9/rpm/barnyard2.config /etc/default/barnyard2
    
```






Do the same thing in the **/etc/init.d/barnyard2** file and add the following to it:




    

```
    ### BEGIN INIT INFO
    # Provides: barnyard2
    # Required-Start: $remote_fs $syslog
    # Required-Stop: $remote_fs $syslog
    # Default-Start: 2 3 4 5
    # Default-Stop: 0 1 6
    # Short-Description: Start Barnyard
    
```






and fix the paths to fit your local install. Here were the entries I had in my **/etc/default/barnyard2** file:




    

```
    LOG_FILE="merged.log"
    SNORTDIR="/usr/local/snort/var/log"
    INTERFACES="eth0"
    CONF=/usr/local/by/etc/barnyard2.conf
    EXTRA_ARGS=""
    
```






I was able to add the service without issues:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo update-rc.d barnyard2 defaults
    update-rc.d: using dependency based boot sequencing
    
```






then here is how the service start looked like:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo service barnyard2 start
    Starting Snort Output Processor (barnyard2): Running in Continuous mode
    
            --== Initializing Barnyard2 ==--
    Initializing Input Plugins!
    Initializing Output Plugins!
    Parsing config file "/usr/local/by/etc/barnyard2.conf"
    
```






After it started I saw the following process running:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$ps -eaf | grep barnya
    snort     2843     1  0 18:40 ?        00:00:00 /usr/local/by/bin/barnyard2 -c /usr/local/by/etc/barnyard2.conf -a /usr/local/snort/var/log/archive -f merged.log -d /usr/local/snort/var/log
    
```






### Move Snort and Barnyard Logs to Dedicated files





The daemon related logs from both of those services went into **/var/log/daemon.log** and I wanted to separate them out for ease of finding errors. So I added the following into my **rsyslog** config:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$cat /etc/rsyslog.d/by.conf 
    if $programname == 'barnyard2' then /var/log/barnyard.log
    & ~
    
    elatov@kerch:~$cat /etc/rsyslog.d/snort.conf 
    if $programname == 'snort' then /var/log/snort.log
    & ~
    
```






To apply the above, restart the rsyslog service:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$ sudo service rsyslog restart
    
```






After that if I restarted **barnyard2** , I could just check out the following log to make sure it's working properly:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$tail -4 /var/log/barnyard.log 
    Apr  6 18:40:09 kerch barnyard2: Barnyard2 initialization completed successfully (pid=2843)
    Apr  6 18:40:09 kerch barnyard2: Using waldo file '/usr/local/snort/var/log/barnyard2.waldo':#012    spool directory = /usr/local/snort/var/log#012    spool filebase  = merged.log#012    time_stamp      = 1396830547#012    record_idx      = 25
    Apr  6 18:40:09 kerch barnyard2: Opened spool file '/usr/local/snort/var/log/merged.log.1396830547'
    Apr  6 18:40:09 kerch barnyard2: Waiting for new data
    
```






And same thing for the snort start up:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$tail /var/log/snort.log
    Apr  6 18:29:07 kerch snort[2652]: PID path stat checked out ok, PID path set to /var/run/
    Apr  6 18:29:07 kerch snort[2652]: Writing PID "2652" to file "/var/run//snort_eth0.pid"
    Apr  6 18:29:07 kerch snort[2652]: Set gid to 112
    Apr  6 18:29:07 kerch snort[2652]: Set uid to 1002
    Apr  6 18:29:07 kerch snort[2652]: 
    Apr  6 18:29:07 kerch snort[2652]:         --== Initialization Complete ==--
    Apr  6 18:29:07 kerch snort[2652]: Commencing packet processing (pid=2652)
    
```






You could also check the snort statistic by sending a **USR1** signal to it:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$sudo kill -USR1 19354
    
```






Then we should see the following under **/var/log/snort.log**:




    

```
    Packet I/O Totals:
        Received:     12556909
        Analyzed:     12556903 (100.000%)
        Dropped:            0 (  0.000%)
        Filtered:            0 (  0.000%)
        Outstanding:            6 (  0.000%)
        Injected:            0
    
```






Good thing to check to make sure the snort sensor is not overloaded (checking the **Dropped** percentage. Lastly here are my **logrotate** configuration files for each log file:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$cat /etc/logrotate.d/snort
    /var/log/snort.log {
        daily
        rotate 7
        compress
        missingok
        notifempty
        create 0640 snort snort
        sharedscripts
        postrotate
            if [ -x /usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d ]; then \
                invoke-rc.d snortd restart > /dev/null; \
            else \
                /etc/init.d/snortd restart > /dev/null; \
            fi;
        endscript
    }
    eltov@kerch:~$cat /etc/logrotate.d/barnyard2
    /var/log/barnyard2.log {
        daily
        rotate 7
        compress
        missingok
        notifempty
        create 0640 snort snort
        sharedscripts
        postrotate
            if [ -x /usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d ]; then \
                invoke-rc.d barnyard2 restart > /dev/null; \
            else \
                /etc/init.d/barnyard2 restart > /dev/null; \
            fi;
        endscript
    }
    
```






### Initial Snort Alerts





After some time if you login to snorby, you should see some alerts:





[![snorby-dashboard](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/snorby-dashboard.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/snorby-dashboard.png)





If you go to the events tab, you will see the specifics:





[![snorby-events](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/snorby-events-1024x229.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/snorby-events.png)





I was getting a bunch of false positive initially, here are some rules I added to suppress some of them:




    

```
    # Suppress the "stream5 tcp small segment threshold"
    suppress gen_id 129, sig_id 12, track by_src, ip 192.168.1.0/24
    # Suppress the "stream5 reset outside window"
    suppress gen_id 129 ,sig_id 15
    # Suppress the "ssh: Protocol mismatch"
    suppress gen_id 128, sig_id 4, track by_dst, ip 192.168.1.0/24
    # Suppress the http_inspect: UNKNOWN METHOD"
    suppress gen_id 119 ,sig_id 31
    
```






These all went into the **/usr/local/snort/etc/rules/local.rules** file. I also disabled the DNP3 pre-processer (I was getting the following messages **dnp3: DNP3 Link-Layer Frame was dropped**), since I wasn't part of such a network. This is done by commenting out the following under the **/usr/local/snort/etc/snort.conf** file:




    

```
    #preprocessor dnp3: ports { 20000 } \
    #   memcap 262144 \
    #   check_crc
    
```






Both of the above required a **service snortd restart**.





### Forward Traffic to Snort Sensor





The best thing to do, would be to put a switch between your Cable Modem and your Router (if you are at home) and then the snort machine would see all the packets. I didn't want to do that, so I setup my dd-wrt router to forward all the packets to a specific IP. This can be accomplished by logging into the dd-wrt router and running the following:




    

```
    iptables -A PREROUTING -t mangle -j ROUTE --gw 192.168.1.x --tee
    iptables -A POSTROUTING -t mangle -j ROUTE --gw 192.168.1.x --tee
    
```






This is not recommended for performance reasons. I kept an eye on my DD-WRT router and I didn't see any performance issues. If the router starts to bog down, I will try to setup the other recommended configuration. BTW from [this](http://www.aboutdebian.com/snort.htm) site, here is suggested approach:

### First Interesting Alert





After a couple of days, I saw the following alert:





[![php-vulnerability](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/php-vulnerability.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/php-vulnerability.png)





[Here](http://humbug.me.uk/linux/trojan.htm) is a little more information about the attack and here is a [link](http://wiki.vpslink.com/Defend_Against_Web_Application_Exploits:_Remote_File_Inclusion_and_Local_Filesystem_Access) that talks about disabling PHP Remote File Inclusion.
