### Associate a stakeholder with the information that needs to be collected.





From the [APAC BrownBag Session 1 Slide Deck](http://portal.sliderocket.com/BLIHZ/VCAP5-DCD-BrownBag---Session-1): [![](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/stake-holders.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/stake-holders.png)





From [this](http://www.virten.net/2012/05/vdcd510-objective-1-1-gather-and-analyze-business-requirements/) blog:





> 
  
> 
> **Project participants (SMEs / Key Stakeholders)**  
A design project manager has to determine a list of SMEs and project stakeholders who can provide information about the design requirements. This list typically includes:
> 
> 
  
  
> 
> 
  
>   * Network administrators
> 
  
>   * Storage administrators
> 
  
>   * Server hardware administrators
> 
  
>   * Operating system administrators
> 
  
>   * Application administrators
> 
  
>   * Security Officer
> 
  
>   * HR representatives
> 
  
>   * C-Level executives (CEO, CTO, CIO,…)
> 
  
>   * Representatives 
> 
  
  
  
> 
> It is important to lists the people involved in this project and their contact information. This list should include:
> 
> 
  
  
> 
> 
  
>   * Name
> 
  
>   * Title
> 
  
>   * Organisation
> 
  
>   * E-Mail address
> 
  
>   * Phone number
> 
  
>   * Reachability 
> 
  
  
  
> 
> Having contact information available will help to make progress without unnecessary interruption during the design process.
> 
> 
  
  
> 
> 
  
>   * Stakeholder = A person with an interest in a project 
> 
  
>   * SME = A subject-matter expert is a person who is an expert in a particular area
> 
  






### Utilize customer inventory and assessment data from a current environment to define a baseline state.





From the [US BrownBag for Objective 1](http://www.slideshare.net/ProfessionalVMware/professionalvmware-brownbag-jason-boche-vcapdcd-objective-1) slide deck:





[![](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/5-step-design-process.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/5-step-design-process.png)





### Analyze customer interview data to explicitly define customer objectives for a conceptual design.





From this [blog's notes](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vcap-dcd_notes.pdf), I decided to write them out just to make it easier to read:





> 
  
> 
> **Conceptual Design: Focus on achieving goals and requirements**
> 
> 
  
  
> 
> 
  
>   * Use information from SME/Stakeholder interviews (Scope/Goals/Requirements/assumptions/constraints) and from information gathered in current state analysis
> 
  
>   * Determine entities affected by project (LOB,users,applications, processes, physical machine, etc)
> 
  
>   * Determine how goals map to each entity
> 
  
>   * Design infrastructure that achieves each entity's goal and requirements but stay within constraints (i.e. where do you need availability, scalability, performance,security and manageability
> 
  
>   * Document with diagrams, tables, and text 
> 
  






From the same [pdf](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vcap-dcd_notes.pdf), here is an example of a conceptual diagram:





[![](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/conceptual_diag1.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/conceptual_diag1.png)





### Identify the need for and apply requirements tracking.





From [this](http://www.virten.net/2012/05/vdcd510-objective-1-1-gather-and-analyze-business-requirements/) blog:





> 
  
> 
> **Requirement tracking**  
It is important to document all requirements. This could be done in an excel sheet for example. Every single requirement should contain at least a unique number, desciption, timestap, priority and the originator.
> 
> 






### Given results of a requirements gathering survey, identify requirements for a conceptual design.





From the above pdf again:





> 
  
> 
> **Architectural Analysis: Deeper Dive into current infrastucture**  
Perform 2 activities
> 
> 
  
  
> 
> 
  
>   1. Current State Analysis: 
  
  
  
>     * Gather and analyze information on current servers,storage,network
> 
  
>     * Gather and analyze application and operating system
> 
  
>     * Gather resource consumption data
> 
  
> 
  
>   2. Envision target state required to meet organizational goals while factoring in requirements, assumptions, and constraints. 
> 
  






Generate a similar conceptual diagram as above. Here is a conceptual diagram from [this](http://www.virten.net/2012/05/vdcd510-objective-1-1-gather-and-analyze-business-requirements/) blog:

### Categorize requirements by infrastructure qualities to prepare for logical design requirements.





From the [PDF](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vcap-dcd_notes.pdf) again:





> 
  
> 
> **Logical Design**
> 
> 
  
  
> 
> 
  
>   * Design includes relationships between all major components of the infrastructure.
> 
  
>   * Considers the conceptual design, constraints, and risks
> 
  
>   * Useful for understanding and evaluating the design of the infrastructure 
  
  
  
>     * Does it meet the requirements but stay within the constraints?
> 
  
> 
  
>   * Does NOT include physical details like port assignments, hardware, vendors, IPs, etc
> 
  
>   * illustrate how to arrange infrastructure components
> 
  
>   * don't get lost in the configuration details
> 
  
>   * be aware of capacity analysis, but include things like LUN sizing, CPU, etc
> 
  
>   * document in diagrams, tables, and text 
> 
  






Here is an example of a logical diagram taken from the pdf:

I would also suggest to watch the following recordings as well:
