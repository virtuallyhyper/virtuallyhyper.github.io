## Study Guide for VCAP5-DCA





As with the VCAP-DCD, I found lot of good resources. I will add them as I go through Objectives. Here are some links for now:







  * [VCAP-DCA Index](http://www.seancrookston.com/vcap-dca/) 



    * Written by Sean Crookston, this is a study guide for VCAP4-DCA. Some of the objectives are similar to version 5 so they will be very helpful. Here is a [link](http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-13726) to the PDF version.




  * [VCAP Datacenter Administration Exam Landing Page VDCA410](http://kendrickcoleman.com/index.php/Tech-Blog/vcap-datacenter-administration-exam-landing-page-vdca410.html) 



    * Written by Kendrick Coleman, very useful guide. Goes through all the objectives.




  * [VCAP-DCA4 Exam](http://damiankarlson.com/vcap-dca4-exam/) 



    * Study Guide Written by Damian Karlson




  * [VCAP4-DCA](http://www.vexperienced.co.uk/vcap-dca/) 



    * Study Guide Written by Edward Grigson, here is a [link](http://www.vexperienced.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/VCAP-study-guide-published-version.pdf) to the PDF version.

    * Written by Ethan Rowe, and it actually covers version 5




  * [VCAP5-DCA](http://www.valcolabs.com/vcap5-dca/)
