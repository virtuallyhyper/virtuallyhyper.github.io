Starting with Version 2.2 of Zabbix, we can now monitor VMware hosts. From [What's new in Zabbix 2.2.0](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.2/manual/introduction/whatsnew220):





> 
  
> 
> A new feature in Zabbix 2.2.0 is VMware virtual machine monitoring. It allows to monitor VMware vCenter and vSphere installations for various VMware hypervisor and virtual machine properties and statistics.
> 
> 
  
  
> 
> Zabbix can use low-level discovery rules to automatically discover VMware hypervisors and virtual machines and create hosts to monitor them, based on pre-defined host prototypes. See Virtual machine monitoring for more detailed information.
> 
> 






So I decided to update Zabbix to 2.2 and Monitor VMware hosts.





### Backup current Zabbix Configuration





All the settings for zabbix are stored under **/etc/zabbix**, so let's backup that directory:




    

```
    sudo tar cpvjf /tmp/zabbix-conf-back.tar.bz2 /etc/zabbix
    
```






If you have the space, backup the MySQL DB as well:




    

```
    mysqldump -h localhost -u zabbix -p zabbix > zabbix.sql
    
```






### Update Zabbix to 2.2





I was using Debian so the process is pretty easy. First stop the service:




    

```
    sudo service zabbix-server stop
    sudo service zabbix-agent stop
    
```






Next get the new repository:




    

```
    wget http://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/2.2/debian/pool/main/z/zabbix-release/zabbix-release_2.2-1+wheezy_all.deb
    
```






Then install the new deb package and update all the packages:




    

```
    sudo dpkg -i zabbix-release_2.2-1+wheezy_all.deb
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
    
```






During the install process it will ask you to setup a Database, **skip** that. The install process will also install new configuration files and will ask you which files you want to keep, choose the following:




    

```
    keep the maintainer version
    
```






There were a lot of new options and I decided to just keep the new configuration and re-add my original settings into the new version. After the install, the zabbix services are automatically started, so let's go ahead and stop them:




    

```
    sudo service zabbix-server stop
    sudo service zabbix-agent stop
    
```






Then fix the configuration to include your original settings, here is what I had after I was done:




    

```
    $sudo grep -Ev "^#|^$" /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf
    LogFile=/var/log/zabbix/zabbix_server.log
    LogFileSize=1
    PidFile=/var/run/zabbix/zabbix_server.pid
    DBHost=localhost
    DBName=zabbix
    DBUser=zabbix
    DBPassword=password
    DBSocket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
    StartIPMIPollers=1
    ListenIP=10.0.0.2
    AlertScriptsPath=/usr/lib/zabbix/alertscripts
    ExternalScripts=/usr/lib/zabbix/externalscripts
    FpingLocation=/usr/bin/fping
    Fping6Location=/usr/bin/fping6
    
```






Then do the same thing for the agentd configuration, here is what I had after I was done:




    

```
    $sudo grep -Ev "^#|^$" /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf
    PidFile=/var/run/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.pid
    LogFile=/var/log/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.log
    LogFileSize=1
    Server=10.0.0.2
    ListenIP=10.0.0.2
    StartAgents=1
    Hostname=me.local.com
    Timeout=15
    Include=/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/
    
```






The new version installs it's own configuration into apache automatically:




    

```
    $ls -l /etc/apache2/conf.d/zabbix
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 23 Feb  8 12:41 /etc/apache2/conf.d/zabbix -> /etc/zabbix/apache.conf
    
```






If you had any apache settings for the frontend you can remove them and just use that configuration. Restart apache after you removed (if any) the settings for the zabbix frontend:




    

```
    sudo service apache2 restart
    
```






Then let's copy our original PHP frontend settings into the new install:




    

```
    sudo cp /etc/zabbix/zabbix.conf.php /etc/zabbix/web/.
    
```






Then start the zabbix services:




    

```
    sudo service zabbix-server start
    sudo service zabbix-agent start
    
```






Check out the logs to make sure everything is okay:




    

```
    less /var/log/zabbix/zabbix-server.log
    less /var/log/zabbix/zabbix-agent.log
    
```






Then visit your PHP frontend (http://localhost/zabbix) and make sure all the information is still there.





### Import VMware Templates





The new VMware Templates are available [here](https://www.zabbix.org/wiki/Zabbix_Templates/Official_Templates#Zabbix_2.2.0). Go ahead and download them:




    

```
    wget https://www.zabbix.org/mw/images/5/50/Template_Virt_VMware-2.2.0.xml 
    wget https://www.zabbix.org/mw/images/5/5d/Template_Virt_VMware_Guest-2.2.0.xml 
    wget https://www.zabbix.org/mw/images/7/7e/Template_Virt_VMware_Hypervisor-2.2.0.xml
    
```






Upon initial import I received the following error:





> 
  
> 
> Cannot find value map "VMware VirtualMachinePowerState" used for item "Power state" on "Template Virt VMware Guest".
> 
> 






Looks like another person ran into a similar issue [here](http://blog.volobuev.su/zabbix-cannot-find-value-map-vmware-virtualmachinepowerstate/) (it's in Russian, but you can always translate it) and the fix is to add a couple of values to the MySQL Database as described in [this](https://www.zabbix.com/forum/showthread.php?p=142941#post142941) forum. [Here](https://www.zabbix.com/forum/showpost.php?p=142098) are the commands that need to be run on the MySQL DB. When I ran the commands they failed, because I was using those values for something else, so I just incremented my **valuemapid** and it worked. Here are the commands I ended up running:




    

```
    INSERT INTO `valuemaps` (`valuemapid`,`name`) values ('13','VMware status');
    INSERT INTO `valuemaps` (`valuemapid`,`name`) values ('14','VMware VirtualMachinePowerState');
    INSERT INTO `mappings` (`mappingid`,`valuemapid`,`value`,`newvalue`) values ('75','13','0','gray');
    INSERT INTO `mappings` (`mappingid`,`valuemapid`,`value`,`newvalue`) values ('76','13','1','green');
    INSERT INTO `mappings` (`mappingid`,`valuemapid`,`value`,`newvalue`) values ('77','13','2','yellow');
    INSERT INTO `mappings` (`mappingid`,`valuemapid`,`value`,`newvalue`) values ('78','13','3','red');
    INSERT INTO `mappings` (`mappingid`,`valuemapid`,`value`,`newvalue`) values ('82','14','0','poweredOff');
    INSERT INTO `mappings` (`mappingid`,`valuemapid`,`value`,`newvalue`) values ('83','14','1','poweredOn');
    INSERT INTO `mappings` (`mappingid`,`valuemapid`,`value`,`newvalue`) values ('84','14','2','suspended');
    
```






After that, I imported the templates in this order:







  1. Template_Virt_VMware_Hypervisor-2.2.0.xml


  2. Template_Virt_VMware_Guest-2.2.0.xml


  3. Template_Virt_VMware-2.2.0.xml





### Enable the VMware Collector on the Zabbix Server





Now that we have the templates in place, let's enable the VMware collector. First make sure the server is compiled with the **libxml2** option. From [Virtual machine monitoring](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.2/manual/vm_monitoring):





> 
  
> 
> For virtual machine monitoring to work, Zabbix should be compiled with the --with-libxml2 and --with-libcurl compilation options.
> 
> 






This can be confirmed, by checking the linked libraries of the binary. Here is what I saw:




    

```
    elatov@kerch:~$ldd /usr/sbin/zabbix_server | grep -E 'xml|curl'
        libxml2.so.2 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxml2.so.2 (0x00007fd56965a000)
        libcurl-gnutls.so.4 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcurl-gnutls.so.4 (0x00007fd567f29000)
    
```






Then to enable the collector I added the following to my **/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf** file:




    

```
    StartVMwareCollectors = 1
    VMwareCacheSize = 8M
    VMwareFrequency = 60
    
```






I then restarted the service:




    

```
    sudo service zabbix_server restart
    
```






and I saw the following in the logs under **/var/log/zabbix/zabbix_server.log**:




    

```

### Enable VMware Discovery





To Discover the Hypervisor and VMs, create a new host and leave the default agent interface:





[![def-inteface-vmware](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/def-inteface-vmware.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/def-inteface-vmware.png)





Then under Macros, define the following:







  * **{$URL}** - VMware service (vCenter or ESX hypervisor) SDK URL (https://servername/sdk).


  * **{$USERNAME}** - VMware service user name


  * **{$PASSWORD}** - VMware service {$USERNAME} user password





[![vm_host_macros](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vm_host_macros.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vm_host_macros.png)





Lastly assign the VMware Template to it:





[![vm_host_templates](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vm_host_templates.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vm_host_templates.png)





After some time, you will see the VMs and Hypervisors discovered and their corresponding templates assigned to them. For example here are two VMs that I was running on one of my hosts:





[![vmware-vms-discovered](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vmware-vms-discovered-1024x42.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vmware-vms-discovered.png)





If you go inside the VM, you will see that most of the items are grayed out:





[![vmwarevm-discovered-detail](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vmwarevm-discovered-detail.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vmwarevm-discovered-detail.png)





and the host is the UUID of the VM. Same thing was done for the hypervisor, except it attached the **VMware Hypervisor** Template to it, instead of the **VMware Guest** one.





### Expanding the VMware Templates





By default the templates didn't have any graphs defined so I ended up defining graphs for CPU Usage and Memory Usage. I just ended up plotting the already existing items and that was pretty easy. I also ended up creating calculated items to help out with some triggers. Here are the calculated items, I added to the Hypervisor Template:





[![added-calculated-items-hv](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/added-calculated-items-hv-1024x63.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/added-calculated-items-hv.png)





Here is what I had in the HV CPU Usage Percentage:





[![hv-cpu-usage-percent](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hv-cpu-usage-percent.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hv-cpu-usage-percent.png)





Here is actual formula:




    

```
    last("vmware.hv.cpu.usage[{$URL},{HOST.HOST}]",0)/(last("vmware.hv.hw.cpu.freq[{$URL},{HOST.HOST}]",0)*last("vmware.hv.hw.cpu.threads[{$URL},{HOST.HOST}]",0))
    
```






I decided to use **vmware.hv.hw.cpu.threads** to calculate total CPU, but **vmware.hv.hw.cpu.num** is also available (I thought it was appropriate since HyperThreading is enabled).





All of the available VMware keys, are listed [here](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.2/manual/config/items/itemtypes/simple_checks/vmware_keys). For creating calculated items, check out the zabbix documentation [Calculated items](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.2/manual/config/items/itemtypes/calculated#usage_examples). And here was the triggers I ended up creating:





[![hv-template-triggers](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hv-template-triggers.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hv-template-triggers.png)





All the trigger functions are defined in [Supported trigger functions](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.2/manual/appendix/triggers/functions). I also ended up modifying the discovery rules to do graphing for the Datastores and to trigger on high latency. I ended up making similar modifications to the VMware Guest Template. BTW the default keys for the VMware Guest are the following:





[![vmware-guest-keys](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vmware-guest-keys.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vmware-guest-keys.png)





It's not much but it's a good start. There are already a couple of feature request to get more data. For example [here](https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBXNEXT-2180) is a link to one asking for the %RDY of the VM. Now I can tell my ESX host is completely under utilized :)





[![cpu-usage-esx](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/cpu-usage-esx.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/cpu-usage-esx.png)
