I wanted to root my HTC Sensation phone, since I have been putting it off for a while. I read some good guides on how to do it, here is a list:

1.  &#8220;<a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-root-htc-sensation-21697/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-root-htc-sensation-21697/']);">How to Root Your HTC Sensation</a>&#8221;

3.  &#8220;<a href="http://www.blogotechblog.com/2012/04/how-to-root-htc-sensationsensation-xe-running-ice-cream-sandwich/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.blogotechblog.com/2012/04/how-to-root-htc-sensationsensation-xe-running-ice-cream-sandwich/']);">How To Root HTC Sensation/Sensation XE Running Ice Cream Sandwich</a>&#8221; 

### 1. Create Backups

Most of the above links, of course, recommended backing up your data just in case. They recommended using &#8220;Titanimum Backup&#8221; and other solutions as well. But all the tools required the phone to be rooted already. What a &#8216;Catch 22&#8242; situation. So then I ran into <a href="http://blog.shvetsov.com/2012/09/backup-your-android-without-root-or.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://blog.shvetsov.com/2012/09/backup-your-android-without-root-or.html']);">this</a> post, it&#8217;s about creating a back up without using any external apps. Starting with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) you can use *adb backup* to create a backup of your applications and data. Here is what I ran:

    [elatov@klaptop platform-tools]$ ./adb backup -f ~/phone/backup -apk -shared -all -nosystem
    Now unlock your device and confirm the backup operation.
    

I then went to my phone and saw the following screen:

<a href="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/phone_backup.png" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/phone_backup.png']);"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5096" title="phone_backup" src="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/phone_backup.png" alt="phone backup Rooting my HTC Sensation Phone" width="540" height="960" /></a>

I didn&#8217;t enter any password and just hit &#8220;Back up my data&#8221; and the back up process started. In the end, I had the following:

    [elatov@klaptop phone]$ ls -lh
    total 867M
    -rw-r----- 1 elatov elatov 867M DecÂ  1 13:21 backup
    

I really wanted to find out if the backups were valid. I then ran into <a href="http://nelenkov.blogspot.com/2012/06/unpacking-android-backups.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://nelenkov.blogspot.com/2012/06/unpacking-android-backups.html']);">this</a> blog. It had a very in depth description of how the back up process works and what encryption algorithms are used. It also had a command on how to convert the android backup to a tar file. Here is the command I ran to convert the backup:

    [elatov@klaptop phone]$ dd if=backup bs=1 skip=24 | openssl zlib -d > mybackup.tar
    3078081068:error:29065064:lib(41):BIO_ZLIB_READ:zlib inflate error:c_zlib.c:570:zlib error:data error
    

At first it failed. I later found a couple of documents that mentioned that there was a bug with the back up utility prior to an update of 4.0.4. I was running 4.0.3, so I was probably running into that. The bug manifests it self, when you include *shared* data (contents of the SD-card) with the *adb backup* command. I then made another backup and didn&#8217;t included the SD-card contents and then trying to convert that backup, it was successful:

    [elatov@klaptop phone]$ dd if=backup2 bs=1 skip=24 | openssl zlib -d > mybackup2.tar
    144560293+0 records in
    144560293+0 records out
    144560293 bytes (145 MB) copied, 510.611 s, 283 kB/s
    

There is also a java application called &#8220;Android Backup Extractor&#8221;. Here is <a href="https://github.com/nelenkov/android-backup-extractor" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://github.com/nelenkov/android-backup-extractor']);">link</a> to that. And someone also wrote a Perl script to &#8220;decrypt&#8221; the back up. Here is a <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1730309" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1730309']);">link</a> to that forum. From the last link they also mention the bug that I ran into:

> I had ran into issues with ADB backups performed under Android 4.0.4 before the JB upgrade (on a Samsung Galaxy Nexus).I did include the shared storage (accidentally or intentionally I don&#8217;t remember) and I ran into this bug (Android issue 28303)

I was just happy to know that I have a valid backup and that I could confirm the data. I then mounted the SD-card from my phone to my laptop and created a manual backup of that, just in case. Here are the commands that I ran on my laptop to get a backup of my SD-card (after I mounted it from my phone):

    $ sudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt/usb/
    $ tar cpvjf ~/phone/phone_sd-card.tar.bz2 /mnt/usb 
    

At the end of the backing up, I had the following files:

    [elatov@klaptop phone]$ ls
    backup  backup2  mybackup2.tar  phone_sd_card_sensation.tar.bz2
    

I then realized that the &#8220;rooting&#8221; steps above are for anyone that has not updated to 4.0.3 ICS, and I unfortunately had already done that. So I found other links, cause the instructions are different. Here are some of the links:

*   &#8220;<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1870233" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1870233']);">How to Root & S-OFF HTC Sensation &#8211; HBOOT 1.27.0000 & Firmware 3.33!</a>&#8220;

I followed mostly the last one.

### 2. Unlock Bootloader, following instructions on http://htcdev.com/bootloader

The website provides their own &#8216;fastboot&#8217; binary. Then you run this:

    [elatov@klaptop downloads]$ chmod +x fastboot
    [elatov@klaptop downloads]$ ./fastboot oem get_identifier_token
    ... INFO
    INFO< Please cut following message >
    INFO< <<< Identifier Token Start >>>>
    INFO015F2941DC2640329F933BC106BA9D94
    INFO18F8DD2079275116654C2BD4E0FFA8D7
    INFOAFD7A21C8xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    INFO24F6F97A3ABExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    INFOExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    INFOxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    INFO< <<<< Identifier Token End >>>>>
    OKAY
    [elatov@klaptop downloads]$
    

You can then upload the above output to their site and they will provide a *.bin* file to unlock your bootloader with the following command:

    [elatov@klaptop downloads]$ ./fastboot  flash unlocktoken Unlock_code.bin
    sending 'unlocktoken' (0 KB)... OKAY
    writing 'unlocktoken'... INFOunlock token check successfully
    OKAY
    

### 3. Install ClockWorkMod Recovery Using Android SDK

Download the \*.img \* file and then run the following to install the image:

    [elatov@klaptop platform-tools]$ ./fastboot flash recovery ~/downloads/recovery.img
    sending 'recovery' (4876 KB)...
    OKAY [  1.160s]
    writing 'recovery'...
    OKAY [ 10.433s]
    finished. total time: 11.594s
    

### 4. Install SuperSU by uploading it to the SD-Card, and then using the ClockWorkMod Recovery to install it

It took a while to find the latest version since the above site had an expired link. But after some *googling* around I found the latest version from <a href="http://www.androidtotal.com/root-install-clockworkmod-recovery-on-htc-sensation-with-android-4.0.3-hboot-1.27.000/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.androidtotal.com/root-install-clockworkmod-recovery-on-htc-sensation-with-android-4.0.3-hboot-1.27.000/']);">here</a>. After you have the file, do the following to install it:

*   Upload the file onto the SD-card.
*   Boot into CWM Recovery.
*   Select install Zip File from SD-card.

### 5. Follow instructions laid out in http://unlimited.io/juopunutbear.htm to turn S-OFF with the &#8220;wire trick&#8221;

Here is how wire trick looked like from the terminal:

    [elatov@klaptop bear]$ sudo ./ControlBear

### 6. Change CID, so you can install any ROM on your device

All the sites had the same instructions. Here is what I did to accomplish that:

    [elatov@klaptop platform-tools]$ ./adb reboot-bootloader
    [elatov@klaptop platform-tools]$ ./fastboot devices
    HT164T500742    fastboot
    [elatov@klaptop platform-tools]$ ./fastboot getvar cid
    cid: T-MOB010
    finished. total time: 0.002s
    [elatov@klaptop platform-tools]$ ./fastboot oem writecid 11111111
    ...
    (bootloader) Start Verify: 0
    (bootloader) erase sector 65504 ~ 65535 (32)

    (bootloader) mipi_dsi_cmd_config:panel_id=0x940021
    (bootloader) width=540 height=960
    OKAY [  0.179s]
    finished. total time: 0.180s
    [elatov@klaptop platform-tools]$ ./fastboot reboot-bootloader
    rebooting into bootloader...
    OKAY [  3.312s]
    finished. total time: 3.313s
    [elatov@klaptop platform-tools]$ ./fastboot getvar cid
    cid: 11111111
    finished. total time: 0.002s
    [elatov@klaptop platform-tools]$ ./fastboot reboot
    rebooting...
    
    finished. total time: 1.661s
    

### 7. Pick a custom ROM and install it.

&#8220;<a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2012/06/five-best-android-roms/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2012/06/five-best-android-roms/']);">Five Best Android ROMs</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://tips4droid.com/top-5-custom-rom-for-htc-rezound/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://tips4droid.com/top-5-custom-rom-for-htc-rezound/']);">Top 5 Custom ROM for HTC Rezound</a>&#8221; talk about the different ROMs. I know that Cyanogen is pretty popular and I have used it with my previous phone. There is also the &#8220;Android Revolution HD&#8221;. All of the instructions on how to install Revolution HD, can be found <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1098849" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1098849']);">here</a> and also <a href="http://www.techsliver.com/step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-install-android-revolution-hd-6.4.0-ics-rom-on-htc-sensation-4g/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.techsliver.com/step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-install-android-revolution-hd-6.4.0-ics-rom-on-htc-sensation-4g/']);">here</a>. Doing some research it seemed that the Revolution HD looks exactly the same as ICS and it&#8217;s just over clocked for performance and has a great battery life. I wanted to try out another interface so I decided to go with CyanogenMod. Instructions on how to install that can be found <a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_pyramid" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_pyramid']);">here</a>. Here is a concise list of instructions:

1.  Download the latest CyanogenMod 9 ROM to your computer
2.  Download the latest Google Apps package
3.  Copy the latest CyanogenMod 9 ROM and the Google Apps ZIP files to the root of your HTC Sensationâs SD-card.
4.  Boot into ClockWorkMod Recovery
5.  Make a Nandroid backup of your current ROM by selecting Backup and Restore > Backup.
6.  Select Wipe Data/Factory Reset.
7.  Select the option to Wipe cache partition.
8.  Select Install ZIP from SD-Card > Choose ZIP from SD-Card. Select the latest CyanogenMod 9 ROM.
9.  Select Install ZIP from SD-Card > Choose ZIP from SD-Card again and select the Google Apps package.
10. Reboot the phone. 

After I rebooted I had a brand new Interface to play with; I liked the look.

### 8. Restore Back&#8217;ed up Applications

I then decided to see if my restore would work out. So I connected my phone to laptop and ran the following:

    elatov@klaptop platform-tools]$ ./adb restore ~/phone/backup2 
    Now unlock your device and confirm the restore operation.
    

Then opened up my phone and it asked to allow the restore process and I did. I must say, even though with the back up process it&#8217;s all or nothing (you can&#8217;t choose what apps to restore), the restore went very well. I was able to start up all of my old applications without any issues.
