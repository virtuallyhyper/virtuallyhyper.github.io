Recently the disk that my syspool sits on started to lock up on my Nexenta (NCP) server. I decided to take this opportunity to set up a mirror to migrate the syspool (rpool) to another disk. Attaching a disk as a mirror is normally pretty easy, but this disk did not have any slices on it. Below is how I was able to mirror the OS and migrate to a new syspool disk with out taking any downtime.

First present a new disk to the server and rescan for the disk.


```

# devfsadm -c disk

```


Now check for the disk.


```

# echo |format
Searching for disks...done

AVAILABLE DISK SELECTIONS:
       0. c8t0d0
          /pci@0,0/pci15ad,1976@10/sd@0,0
       1. c8t1d0
          /pci@0,0/pci15ad,1976@10/sd@1,0
       2. c8t2d0
          /pci@0,0/pci15ad,1976@10/sd@2,0

...

Specify disk (enter its number): Specify disk (enter its number):

```


In this case c8t1d0 is my new disk. Below is my existing syspool (please ignore the older format message. I am still running 26 on my syspool)


```

# zpool status syspool
  pool: syspool
 state: ONLINE
status: The pool is formatted using an older on-disk format.  The pool can
        still be used, but some features are unavailable.
action: Upgrade the pool using 'zpool upgrade'.  Once this is done, the
        pool will no longer be accessible on older software versions.
 scan:  scrub repaired 0 in 0h10m with 0 errors on Mon Aug 13 09:02:23 2012
config:

        NAME          STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        syspool       ONLINE       0     0     0
          c8t0d0s0    ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: No known data errors

```


So we will need to attach the disk as a mirror of c8t0d0s0. The problem is that c8t1d0 does not have a slice, so we can either create one using partition in format, or we can clone the slice from c8t0d0s0. Below we will clone the slice from c8t0d0s0.


```

# prtvtoc /dev/dsk/c8t0d0s0 |fmthard -s - /dev/rdsk/c8t1d0s0
fmthard:  New volume table of contents now in place.

```


Now let's add the disk as a mirror to c8t0d0s0. The -f is to force the operation.


```

# zpool attach -f syspool c8t0d0s0 c8t1d0s0

```


Now we need to install grub to make the new disk bootable.


```

root@fileserver2:/boot/grub# installgrub /boot/grub/stage1 /boot/grub/stage2 /dev/rdsk/c8t1d0s0
stage1 written to partition 0 sector 0 (abs 4096)
stage2 written to partition 0, 274 sectors starting at 50 (abs 4146)

```


Let's check the status of the resilver.


```

# zpool status syspool
  pool: syspool
 state: ONLINE
status: The pool is formatted using an older on-disk format.  The pool can
        still be used, but some features are unavailable.
action: Upgrade the pool using 'zpool upgrade'.  Once this is done, the
        pool will no longer be accessible on older software versions.
 scan: resilvered 6.51G in 0h4m with 0 errors on Mon Aug 13 09:07:23 2012
config:

        NAME          STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        syspool       ONLINE       0     0     0
          mirror-0    ONLINE       0     0     0
            c8t0d0s0  ONLINE       0     0     0
            c8t1d0s0  ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: No known data errors

```


So now it is setup and ready to run as a mirrored zpool. In my case I wanted to remove the original drive, which can be done with the following command.


```

# zpool detach syspool c8t1d0s0

```


I would recommend running the syspool on a mirror, as I will when I replace the original disk.
