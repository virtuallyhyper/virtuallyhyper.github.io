I initialized my *vagrant* environment with the following:

	elatov@kmac:~$mkdir test
	elatov@kmac:~$cd test
	elatov@kmac:~/test$vagrant init elatov/opensuse13-64
	A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
	ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
	the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
	`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.

Then I modified the **Vagrantfile** to configure multiple VMs:

	elatov@kmac:~/test$cat Vagrantfile
	# -*- mode: ruby -*-
	# vi: set ft=ruby :
	boxes = [
	  { :name => :web,:ip => '192.168.33.1',:ssh_port => 2201,:cpus => 1, :mem => 512},
	  { :name => :db,:ip => '192.168.33.2',:ssh_port => 2202,:cpus => 1,:mem => 512 },
	  ]
	
	# Vagrantfile API/syntax version. Don't touch unless you know what you're doing!
	VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = "2"
	
	Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|
	    boxes.each do |opts|
	        config.vm.define opts[:name] do |config|
	    	    config.vm.box       = "elatov/opensuse13-64"
	    	    config.vm.box_url   = "https://vagrantcloud.com/elatov/opensuse13-64/version/1/provider/virtualbox.box"
	    	    config.vm.network  "private_network", ip: opts[:ip]
	    	    config.vm.network  "forwarded_port", guest: 22, host: opts[:ssh_port]
	    	    config.vm.hostname = "%s.vagrant" % opts[:name].to_s
	    	    config.vm.synced_folder "~/stuff", "/vagrant"
		    config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
	  	    # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM
	    	        vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", opts[:cpus] ] if opts[:cpus]
	    	        vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", opts[:mem] ] if opts[:mem]
		    end
	       end
	    end
	end

Upon starting up the environment, I saw the following:

	elatov@kmac:~/test$vagrant up

	The following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.
	Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!
	
	/sbin/ifup eth1 2> /dev/null
	
	Stdout from the command:
	
	
	
	Stderr from the command:

Going into the VM, I saw that our second interface is called **enp0s8**:

	elatov@kmac:~/test$vagrant ssh web
	Last login: Thu Jun 12 13:35:06 2014 from 10.0.2.2
	Have a lot of fun...
	vagrant@web:~> ip link ls
	1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT
	    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
	2: enp0s3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT qlen 1000
	    link/ether 08:00:27:ef:b3:96 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
	3: enp0s8: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT qlen 1000
	    link/ether 08:00:27:66:36:06 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
	    
I saw an update on [github](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/1997) for vagrant to fix that. It's supposed to be fixed, but we would have to compile the vagrant software. I also ran into the [following](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/81834/how-can-i-change-the-default-ens33-network-device-to-old-eth0-on-fedora-19). From that page, we can pass a couple of parameters to the kernel to revert the old network interface names (**eth\***). From that site:

> The easiest way to restore the old way Kernel/modules/udev rename your ethernet interfaces is supplying these kernel parameters to Fedora 19:
> 
> 1. net.ifnames=0
> 2. biosdevname=0
> 
> To do so follow this steps:
> 
> 1. Edit /etc/default/grub
> 2. At the end of GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX line append "net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0"
> 3. Save the file
> 4. Type "grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg"
> 5. Type "reboot"

So let's try it out. Boot into the template VM and add those lines:

	vagrant@linux-nhp0:~> grep GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX= /etc/default/grub
	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0"

Then rebuild the **initrd** again:

	vagrant@linux-nhp0:~> sudo mkinitrd
	
	Kernel image:   /boot/vmlinuz-3.11.10-11-default
	Initrd image:   /boot/initrd-3.11.10-11-default
	Root device:	/dev/systemVG/LVRoot (mounted on / as ext3)

Then before you reboot, copy the network scripts:

	vagrant@linux-nhp0:~>sudo mv /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-enp0s3 /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0
	vagrant@linux-nhp0:~>sudo mv /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-enp0s8 /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth1

Then reboot the OS:

	vagrant@linux-nhp0:~> sudo reboot

After the reboot, you should see the new inteface names:

	vagrant@linux-nhp0:~> ip -4 a
	1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN
	    inet 127.0.0.1/8 brd 127.255.255.255 scope host lo
	       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
	2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
	    inet 10.0.2.15/24 brd 10.0.2.255 scope global eth0
	       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
	3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
	    inet 192.168.56.101/24 brd 192.168.56.255 scope global eth1
	       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
	       
Making that into a box and trying again, the VMs booted up without issues :)

Both machines had the right IPs and the *virtualbox* share :
