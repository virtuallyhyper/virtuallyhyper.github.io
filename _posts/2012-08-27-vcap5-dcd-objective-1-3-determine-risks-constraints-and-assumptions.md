### Differentiate between the general concepts of a risk, a requirement, a constraint, and an assumption.

From the [US BrownBag Objective 1](http://www.slideshare.net/ProfessionalVMware/professionalvmware-brownbag-jason-boche-vcapdcd-objective-1) Slide Deck:

### Given a statement, determine whether it is a risk, requirement, a constraint, or an assumption

From this [PDF](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vcap-dcd_notes.pdf):

> **Architectural Vision: A high level vision for the project** includes the following aspects:
>
> 1.  Scope - Identify Scope in detail
>     *   Defined scope prevents unintended expansion (ie this project includes the US productions servers only. No dev/test and no Canada servers)
>     *   prevents the need to renegotiate cost of project or work for fee
> 2.  Goals - set specific goals for a project
>     *   Goals need to be specific, measurable, and actionable
>     *   without goals it is difficult to determine success and value of a project
>     *   i.e the organization wants to achieve a 50% reduction in production server equipment by the end of the year
> 3.  Requirements - Identify key business and technical requirements for the project
>     *   ie, SOX compliance, physical separation from production and dev/test, up-time requirements, etc
> 4.  Assumptions- Design components that are assumed valid without proof
>     *   i.e. the organization has sufficient bandwidth between sites for replication
> 5.  Constrains - constraints limit the design choices, could be a policy, process, or technical constraint
>     *   i.e. due to existing relationships all hardware is dell
> 6.  Risks - Identify risks that might prevent achieving project goals
>     *   i.e. lack of core redundancy introduces risk of %99.99 up-time
>     *   discussing risks eliminated surprise

### Analyze impact of VMware best practices to identified risks, constraints, and assumptions

From the [US BrownBag Objective 1](http://www.slideshare.net/ProfessionalVMware/professionalvmware-brownbag-jason-boche-vcapdcd-objective-1) Slide Deck:

Basically try to be flexible with best practices, not everything falls under best practices or a certain criteria. For this section the Blue Print has a link to an excellent document from Glasshouse, I would definitely recommend reading it: [Developing Your Virtualization Strategy and Deployment Plan](http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-17431)
