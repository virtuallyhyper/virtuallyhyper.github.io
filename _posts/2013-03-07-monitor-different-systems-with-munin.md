This is the second part and continuation of the 'Network Monitoring Software Comparison' series. Here is the link to the [first][1] part. Let's go ahead and check out our software: **Munin**. From their [main][2] page, here is a quick snippet:

> Munin uses the excellent â€‹RRDTool (written by Tobi Oetiker) and the framework is written in Perl, while plugins may be written in any language. Munin has a master/node architecture in which the master connects to all the nodes at regular intervals and asks them for data. It then stores the data in RRD files, and (if needed) updates the graphs.

So Munin uses Master/node terminology, but let's get to it.

### 1. Install Munin-Master on the Ubuntu machine

Instructions on how to install

Munin installation instructions are available from <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/LinuxInstallation" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/LinuxInstallation']);">this</a> Munin page. To install it, just run this:

    kerch:~>sudo apt-get install munin
    

Now to configure it. The master config file for Munin is **/etc/munin/munin.conf**. Explanation of the settings and options for this file are <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/munin.conf" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/munin.conf']);">here</a>. So I edited the file and added/modified the following section:

    [kerch.dnsd.me] 
      address 127.0.0.1 
      use_node_name yes
    

The Munin master system doesn't have a daemon process, it does it's work via **cron**:

    kerch:~>ls -1 /etc/cron.d/mu* 
    /etc/cron.d/munin 
    /etc/cron.d/munin-node
    

Every 5 minutes it checks the configuration files and then generates or collects the appropriate RRD files, which are then converted to graphs. The install process also sets up an **Apache** configuration file to serve it's graphs:

    kerch:~>ls /etc/apache2/conf.d/mu* 
    /etc/apache2/conf.d/munin
    

I will be monitoring the Master machine as well, luckily the **munin-node** package was auto installed when we installed the **munin** package. The configuration for a munin node is under /**etc/munin/munin-node.conf**. Usually we need to setup the IP of the master in that file, but since it will just monitor the local system, we don't need to make any changes. Information on all the settings for that file are <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/munin-node.conf" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/munin-node.conf']);">here</a>. Now that everything is configured, let's make sure **munin-node** is running:

    kerch:~>sudo service munin-node status 
    munin-node start/running, process 3619
    

That looks good, as a quick test we can **telnet** to the daemon locally and fetch the load information:

    kerch:~>telnet localhost 4949
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    # munin node at kerch.dnsd.me
    fetch load
    load.value 0.31
    

That looks good, then going to ****, I saw the following page: <a href="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-first-page.png" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-first-page.png']);"><img src="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-first-page.png" alt="munin first page Monitor Different Systems with Munin" width="879" height="363" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6378" title="Monitor Different Systems with Munin" /></a> Then checking out the 'Network Firewall' stats for the day, I saw the following. <a href="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-disk-usage.png" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-disk-usage.png']);"><img src="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-disk-usage.png" alt="munin disk usage Monitor Different Systems with Munin" width="808" height="464" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6379" title="Monitor Different Systems with Munin" /></a> It looks like it started collecting data. Clicking on the host itself produces a page with all the graphs and it took a while to load 20+ graphs. I suppose I could disable some of the plugins :). From the <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/munin-node.conf" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/munin-node.conf']);">munin-node.conf</a> page we see this directive:

    ignore_file Files to ignore when locating plugins. Directive may be repeated.
    

Checking out that setting on my setup:

    kerch:~>grep ignore /etc/munin/munin-node.conf
    # Regexps for files to ignore
    ignore_file [\#~]$
    ignore_file DEADJOE$
    ignore_file \.bak$
    ignore_file %$
    ignore_file \.dpkg-(tmp|new|old|dist)$
    ignore_file \.rpm(save|new)$
    ignore_file \.pod$ 
    

So anything with a **.bak** extension gets ignored. Here were the plugins that were enabled:

    kerch:~>ls -Cw 80 /etc/munin/plugins/
    cpu                     fw_packets      nfs4_client             processes
    df                      if_err_eth0     nfs_client              proc_pri
    df_inode                if_eth0         nfsd                    swap
    diskstats               interrupts      nfsd4.bak               threads
    entropy                 irqstats        open_files              uptime
    forks.bak               load            open_inodes             users
    fw_conntrack            memory          postfix_mailqueue       vmstat
    fw_forwarded_local      munin_stats     postfix_mailvolume
    

So I moved some of the links to have the **.bak** extension, ie:

    kerch:~>sudo mv /etc/munin/plugins/users /etc/munin/plugins/users.bak
    

Then to apply the new settings, we need to restart the **munin-node** service:

    kerch:~>sudo service munin-node restart 
    munin-node stop/waiting 
    munin-node start/running, process 9678
    

Lastly, to double check if the plugin is really disabled:

    kerch:~>telnet localhost 4949
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    # munin node at kerch.dnsd.me
    fetch users
    # Unknown service
    

After disabling a bunch of the plugins it still took a while to load the page, but that at least it looked more organized. Now let's configure a remote node to send data to the master.

### 2. Install Munin-node on FreeBSD

As always, find the package:

    freebsd:~>whereis munin-node 
    munin-node: /usr/ports/sysutils/munin-node
    

Then let's install the software:

    freebsd:~>cd /usr/ports/sysutils/munin-node/ 
    freebsd:/usr/ports/sysutils/munin-node/>sudo make install clean
    

After the install is done, enable the service by editing **/etc/rc.conf** and adding the following:

    munin_node_enable="YES"
    

Then let's allow out master to connect to this node. Edit **/usr/local/etc/munin/munin-node.conf** and add the following line:

    allow ^192\.168\.1\.100$
    

Then start the service:

    freebsd:~>sudo /usr/local/etc/rc.d/munin-node start 
    Starting munin_node.
    

Check to make sure it's working locally:

    freebsd:~>telnet localhost 4949
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.localdomain.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    # munin node at freebsd.dnsd.me
    fetch load
    load.value 0.01
    

Then go back to the master and add the node to the configuration. This is done by editing **/etc/munin/munin.conf** and adding the following section:

    [freebsd.dnsd.me] 
      address 192.168.1.101 
      use_node_name yes
    

Then trying to connect from the master to the node:

    kerch:~>telnet 192.168.1.101 4949
    Trying 192.168.1.101...
    Connected to 192.168.1.101.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    # munin node at freebsd.dnsd.me
    fetch load
    load.value 0.02
    

Then checking the logs after the Cron job ran, I saw the following:

    kerch:~>tail -5 /var/log/munin/munin-update.log 
    2013/02/20 11:55:08 [INFO]: Munin-update finished for node dnsd.me;kerch.dnsd.me (5.45 sec) 
    2013/02/20 11:55:09 [INFO]: Munin-update finished for node dnsd.me;freebsd.dnsd.me (6.15 sec) 
    2013/02/20 11:55:09 [INFO] Reaping Munin::Master::UpdateWorker<dnsd .me;kerch.dnsd.me>. Exit value/signal: 0/0 
    2013/02/20 11:55:09 [INFO] Reaping Munin::Master::UpdateWorker</dnsd><dnsd .me;freebsd.dnsd.me>. Exit value/signal: 0/0 
    2013/02/20 11:55:10 [INFO]: Munin-update finished (7.05 sec)  
    

We can see that both nodes have been updated. You can also check under **/var/lib/munin** to make sure information about both nodes exist:

    kerch:~>ls -1 /var/lib/munin/state* 
    /var/lib/munin/state-dnsd.me-freebsd.dnsd.me.storable 
    /var/lib/munin/state-dnsd.me-kerch.dnsd.me.storable
    

Lastly vising the site, I saw both nodes like so: <a href="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-two-nodes.png" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-two-nodes.png']);"><img src="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-two-nodes.png" alt="munin two nodes Monitor Different Systems with Munin" width="514" height="63" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6380" title="Monitor Different Systems with Munin" /></a>

Also clicking 'system' for the day, will show the CPU usage side by side for both nodes, it looks like this: <a href="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-cpu-side-by-side.png" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-cpu-side-by-side.png']);"><img src="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-cpu-side-by-side.png" alt="munin cpu side by side Monitor Different Systems with Munin" width="811" height="334" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6381" title="Monitor Different Systems with Munin" /></a> I also like the fact that they had warning level setup for certain statistics. For example by default it would show me when the latency of a device was high. I just clicked on 'warning' (under problems) and it showed me this: <a href="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-warning.png" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-warning.png']);"><img src="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-warning.png" alt="munin warning Monitor Different Systems with Munin" width="996" height="566" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6382" title="Monitor Different Systems with Munin" /></a> As I did with the Ubuntu machine, we can do the same thing and disable plugins under **/usr/local/etc/munin/plugins** on the FreeBSD machine as well. Now let's set up the Fedora node.

### 3. Install Munin-node on Fedora

Let's use **yum** to install the software:

    moxz:~>sudo yum install munin-node
    

There were a few dependencies, mostly *Perl* modules. Next let's configure the node to allow the master to connect to it. Edit **/etc/munin/munin-node.conf** and add the following entry:

    allow ^192.168.1.100$
    

Let's enable the **munin-node** service:

    moxz:~>sudo systemctl enable munin-node 
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/munin-node.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/munin-node.service'
    

Next, let's start the service and make sure it's up:

    moxz:~>sudo systemctl start munin-node 
    moxz:~>sudo systemctl status munin-node
    munin-node.service - Munin Node Server.
              Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/munin-node.service; enabled)
              Active: active (running) since Wed 2013-02-27 13:08:16 PST; 1 day 1h ago
                Docs: man:munin-node
            Main PID: 796 (munin-node)
              CGroup: name=systemd:/system/munin-node.service
                      â””â”€796 /usr/bin/perl -wT /usr/sbin/munin-node
    

Next, let's sure we can connect locally:

    moxz:~>telnet localhost 4949
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    # munin node at moxz.dnsd.me
    fetch load
    load.value 0.01
    

Next, let's edit the firewall to allow our master to connect to TCP port **4949**. Edit **/etc/sysconfig/iptables**, and add the following:

    -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/24 -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 4949 -j ACCEPT
    

I enabled my whole local subnet, but if you want to be more secure, you can just allow the Master's IP address. Lastly restart the **iptables** instance to apply the settings:

    moxz:~>sudo systemctl restart iptables
    

Now let's go to the master and add our new node. On the Ubuntu machine edit **/etc/munin/munin.conf** and add the following:

    [moxz.dnsd.me] 
      address 192.168.1.102
      use_node_name yes
    

Also make sure you can connect to the node from the master:

    kerch:~>telnet 192.168.1.102 4949
    Trying 192.168.1.102...
    Connected to 192.168.1.102.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    # munin node at moxz.dnsd.me
    fetch load
    load.value 0.03
    

That looks good. Then wait for the Cron job to finish and check the logs to confirm it looks good:

    kerch:~>tail -4 /var/log/munin/munin-update.log 
    2013/02/20 13:45:13 [INFO]: Munin-update finished for node dnsd.me;moxz.dnsd.me (9.94 sec) 
    2013/02/20 13:45:13 [INFO] Reaping Munin::Master::UpdateWorker</dnsd><dnsd .me;kerch.dnsd.me>. Exit value/signal: 0/0 
    2013/02/20 13:45:13 [INFO] Reaping Munin::Master::UpdateWorker</dnsd><dnsd .me;moxz.dnsd.me>. Exit value/signal: 0/0 
    2013/02/20 13:45:14 [INFO]: Munin-update finished (11.19 sec)
    

Look like the node was added without issues. Checking out the management page (**127.0.0.1/munin**), confirmed that the node was there. As with the previous setups, we can disable any plugins under **/etc/munin/plugins**. Now let's monitor our raid disk status.

### 4. Create a Custom Script for the FreeBSD Munin-node to Monitor Raid Status

Instructions on how to write a plug-in for *Munin* are <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/HowToWritePlugins" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/HowToWritePlugins']);">here</a>. Following the instuctions from the site, I wrote this script:

<pre class="brush: /bin/sh; notranslate">case $1 in
   config)
        cat &lt; &lt;'EOM'
graph_title Raid_Status 
graph_vlabel #_Disks
raid.label #_Disks
graph_args --base 1000 -l 0
graph_noscale true
graph_category disk
load.critical 1
graph_info Show Disks Online at a certain time
raid.info Online Disks from the Raid
EOM
        exit 0;;
esac
val=$(/usr/local/sbin/arcconf getconfig 1 PD | grep State | grep Online| /usr/bin/wc -l)
echo "raid.value $(echo $val)"


Here is what the script produced as ouput:

    freebsd:~>./raid.sh 
    raid.value 2 
    freebsd:~>./raid.sh config
    graph_title Raid_Status 
    graph_vlabel #_Disks
    raid.label #_Disks
    graph_args --base 1000 -l 0
    graph_noscale true
    graph_category disk
    load.critical 1
    graph_info Show Disks Online at a certain time
    raid.info Online Disks from the Raid
    

Then installing the plugin:

    freebsd:~>sudo cp raid.sh /usr/local/etc/munin/plugins/raid
    

Now for the test:

    freebsd:~>munin-run raid 
    raid.value 2 
    freebsd:~>munin-run raid config
    graph_title Raid_Status 
    graph_vlabel #_Disks
    raid.label #_Disks
    graph_args --base 1000 -l 0
    graph_noscale true
    graph_category disk
    load.critical 1
    graph_info Show Disks Online at a certain time
    raid.info Online Disks from the Raid 
    

That all looks good, lastly let's restart the service and check if it works:

    freebsd:~>sudo service munin-node restart
    Stopping munin_node.
    Waiting for PIDS: 90682.
    Starting munin_node.
    

Now for a quick test.

    freebsd:~>telnet localhost 4949
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.localdomain.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    # munin node at freebsd.dnsd.me
    fetch raid
    raid.value 2
    

That looks good. Wait 5 minutes then check to see if a new RRD file has been generated on the master, here is what I saw after 5 minutes:

    kerch:~>ls -1 /var/lib/munin/dnsd.me/*raid* 
    /var/lib/munin/dnsd.me/freebsd.dnsd.me-raid-load-g.rrd 
    /var/lib/munin/dnsd.me/freebsd.dnsd.me-raid-raid-g.rrd
    

Also checking out the values of the RRD file, I saw the following:

    kerch:~>rrdtool fetch /var/lib/munin/dnsd.me/freebsd.dnsd.me-raid-raid-g.rrd AVERAGE | tail -4 
    1361402700: nan 
    1361403000: nan 
    1361403300: 2.0000000000e+00 
    1361403600: nan
    

Looks like our average value is 2, which is perfect. Going to the site and zooming in on the graph, I saw the following. <a href="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-raid_status.png" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-raid_status.png']);"><img src="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-raid_status.png" alt="munin raid status Monitor Different Systems with Munin" width="910" height="522" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6420" title="Monitor Different Systems with Munin" /></a> It just started to gather data and it looked okay. Now for the comparison

### 5. Collectd Vs. Munin

#### Pros for Munin

1.  The configuration split up, **munin.conf** for master and **munin-node.conf** for nodes
2.  The install configured *Apache* automatically
3.  Flexible plugins, even though I accomplished the same with *Collectd*, *Munin* seems to be more extensible (and it's known for that)
4.  The management web page shows any thresholds that have entered critical state

#### Cons for Munins

1.  The Management Page loads all the graphs at once and it takes a while to process
2.  *Munin* runs on *Perl*, therefore many dependencies had to be installed
3.  Higher CPU Utilization 
    *   Checking out **top**, I saw **munin-html** take 90% of the CPU, while *Collectd* is around 1%. Check it out: <a href="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-cpu-usage_g.png" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-cpu-usage_g.png']);"><img src="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/munin-cpu-usage_g.png" alt="munin cpu usage g Monitor Different Systems with Munin" width="723" height="200" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6376" title="Monitor Different Systems with Munin" /></a>
    *   Lastly I don't know if you want to call this irony, but I checked *Collectd* graphs and here is what I saw: <a href="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/collectd_cpu_usage_after_munin.png</dnsd>" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/collectd_cpu_usage_after_munin.png</dnsd']);"><img src="http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/collectd_cpu_usage_after_munin.png" alt="collectd cpu usage after munin Monitor Different Systems with Munin" width="640" height="395" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6393" title="Monitor Different Systems with Munin" /></a> At about 20:30 I installed *Munin* on the system, and right after that we see a spike in CPU usage every 5 minutes.
4.  The setup depends on *cron*, if you made a change, you need to wait 5 minutes for the changes to occur, with *Collectd* you can just restart the agent
5.  Traffic is TCP, more overhead. *Collectd* uses udp.
