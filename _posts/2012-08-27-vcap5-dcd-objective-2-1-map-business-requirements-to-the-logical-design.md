### Explain the common components of logical design


I covered this in the previous objective, but I will use the same material:


> **Logical Design**

> 
> 
	
>   * Design includes relationships between all major components of the infrastructure.
> 
	
>   * Considers the conceptual design, constraints, and risks
> 
	
>   * Useful for understanding and evaluating the design of the infrastructure

	
>     * Does it meet the requirements but stay within the constraints?
> 


> 
	
>   * Does NOT include physical details like port assignments, hardware, vendors, IPs, etc
> 
	
>   * illustrate how to arrange infrastructure components
> 
	
>   * don't get lost in the configuration details
> 
	
>   * be aware of capacity analysis, but include things like LUN sizing, CPU, etc
> 
	
>   * document in diagrams, tables, and text
> 






### List the detailed steps that go into the makeup of a common logical design


Same as the previous objective


### Differentiate functional and non-functional requirements for the design


From [this](http://www.virten.net/2012/05/vdcd510-objective-1-1-gather-and-analyze-business-requirements/) blog:


> **Functional requirements** are tasks or processes that must be performed by the system. For example, a functional requirement of a vSphere platform is “must allow multi tenancy” or “users must be able to create virtual machines”.

**Non-functional requirements** are standards that the system under must have or comply with. For example, a non-functional requirements for a vSphere platform is “must be built for a total cost of $500.000″. Non-Functional requirements are also called constraints.




### Build non-functional requirements into a specific logical design


If we checkout a picture from the previous objective:
[![](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/another-conceptual-diag.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/another-conceptual-diag.png)
We can see that our non-functional requirement was that the web-server has to be in a DMZ, but we don't really have specific IPs of all the firewalls involved in the setup.


### Translate given business requirements and the current state of a customer environment into a logical design


If we again look at this picture from the previous objectives:
[![](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/logical-diagram.png)](http://virtuallyhyper.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/logical-diagram.png)

We can see that a non-functional requirement was to allow for a protected site. We don't really mention if SRM will be used or if we will be using Array Based replication or vSphere Based Replication. We just have a logical diagram of a protected site that is replicated.


### Create a Service Catalog


From this blog:


> **Service Catalog**
A new part in this objective and derived from ITIL is the service catalog. A service catalog is a list of services that a company provides to its customers. The catalog should provide the following information:

> 
> 
	
>   * Service name (Extended Support)
> 
	
>   * Service description (Maintenance and support of servers and components)
> 
	
>   * Services included (Patch management, upgrades, incident support)
> 
	
>   * Services not included (Non-standard changes)
> 
	
>   * Services availability  (24x7x365)
> 




If you want more information on Service Catalog, I would suggest reading this paper mentioned in the blue print:
