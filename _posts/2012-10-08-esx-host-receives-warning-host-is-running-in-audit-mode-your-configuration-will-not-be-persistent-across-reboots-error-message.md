Recently saw the message outlined in the title from an ESXi host. Logged into the host via ssh and checked out the logs. Here is what I saw:


```

/var/log # grep -i audit messages
Sep 26 18:22:28 vmkernel: TSC: 1899066536 cpu0:0)BootConfig: 110: auditMode = TRUE

```


It looks like AuditMode was set to true. Checking out the 'boot.cfg' file, I saw the following:


```

~ # cat /bootbank/boot.cfg
kernel=b.z
kernelopt=auditMode=TRUE
modules=k.z --- s.z --- c.z --- oem.tgz --- license.tgz --- m.z
build=4.1.0-800380
updated=1
bootstate=0

```


For some reason this line got in there:


```

kernelopt=auditMode=TRUE

```


After some research found VMware Communities [160722](http://communities.vmware.com/thread/160722) page. They mentioned that the fix is to remove that line. Here are the instructions from that page:


> 

> 
> 
	
>   1. enable console support option

	
>     1. F2 -> Troubleshoot options -> enable local TSM support
> 


> 
	
>   2. ALT+F1 log into console
> 
	
>   3. vi /bootbank/boot.cfg

	
>     1. press i (for insert)
> 
	
>     2. remove the line that has auditMode=TRUE
> 
	
>     3. press 'esc' then :w :q (to write changes and quit vi)
> 


> 
	
>   4. reboot server to take it out of audit mode
> 





Remove that line per the instructions above and the server rebooted without going into Audit Mode again.
